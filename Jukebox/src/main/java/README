# Project 3: Jukebox

* Author: Henry J. Schade
* Class: CS 121 Section 004
* Semester: Fall 2016
* Project Name: Jukebox

## Overview
Develop a class to represent a playlist of songs. The driver class with a menu and some methods for 
reading Song data from files will be provided. You will be reusing the class you write later in the 
semester.


## Compiling and Using
Do the following from the command line and in the Project directory.
Compile using: 
	"javac [Project Name]".
Run using: 
	"java [Project Name]"


## Discussion
Everything was pretty straight forward.
When I first wrote my PlayList constructor, I put "public void PlayList(String strPlayListName){".
The void caused issue when the rest of the code tried instanciating a PlayList, it took just a bit to figure 
out where I had messed up.

Google search engine:
For java syntax lookup.  Quick searches on different java methods, and their paramaters.

The code has also been documented with URL's, near the relevent code blocks, that were used to "discover" how 
to implement things we have not been taught yet, that were above and beyond.

Misc URL's that helped along the way:
